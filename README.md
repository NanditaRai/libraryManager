This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps to run the project

In the project directory, you have to run:

1. Run `yarn start:server` in one terminal

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3080](http://localhost:3080) to view it in the browser.

The page will not reload if you make edits. You need to rerun the command<br />
Now the server is up and running.

2. Run `yarn start:client` in other terminal

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
